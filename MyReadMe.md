# Horiseon Homepgae code refactor

## Description 
Horiseon SSS, INC. tasked me with refactoring their main page's CSS and HMTL to make it cleaner and imporve the accessibility of the webpage.  The primary alterations that I made were consolidationg redundantt section specifications, replacing non semantic section names with more semantic ones, and inserting descriptive alt captions for graphics.  

More specifically, I began with changing the title of the webpage from "Title" to the name of the campany, i.e. "Horiseon SSS, INC.".  Next, most sections of the page were identified as divs, so I differentiated them into Header, Body, Hero, Content, and Footer.  In terms of CSS, there were several redundant sections--some I combined, so I got rid of entirely, and some were renamed to match the HTML section names.  Finally, I changed the order of CSS sections (and gave them clear notations) to more closely reflect the order in HTML so that readibility by coders is more streamlined and easy to follow.
